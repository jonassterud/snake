# Snake

First attempt at snake game using C++. Only tested on Linux. You need ncurses and CMake. 
Create the build directory with `mkdir build` and create the build files with `cmake -B build/`.
Then `cd` into the build directory, and run `make`.
Now just run the executable with `./snake` from inside the build directory.

### Contributing
Any advice on things I can do differently, etc. are highly welcomed.
